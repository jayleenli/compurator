Hello, my name is Louie and I am a husband, a father, and a student in pursuit of an education in the field of Computer Science. I am a California Community College transfer from a small hometown located in the Monterey Bay. I enjoy spending quality time with my family, trying new foods, movie nights, and I love to learn new things that interest me. Before becoming a full-time student, I worked in the health field. With over ten years of experience working with Hospice, I grew accustomed to working in teams in a fast-paced environment and I appreciate the knowledge gained throughout my years of service to my community.

My family and I currently reside in Goleta, Ca., meanwhile, I pursue my undergrad in Computer Science. 


--Ideas for our CS48 project--

our team plans to create a project that compares laptops so that the consumer can make a purchase they feel comfortable with. 
I like the idea we discussed of creating a “Notes” section that allows the user to jot down information about the product they are interested in. A sidebar that allows the user to go over all the notes they created. It can be kind of like a bookmarks section. Perhaps to can have a menu that allows the user to filter thru computer options that best suit their needs such as pricing, memory, etc. 

A “share” option would be a pretty neat feature that would allow the user to pass the information to  someone for a second opinion. 

A user friendly experience that anyone can benefit from. Maybe add some customization features so that the user can adjust page to their liking.
