Everyone waas present- we held the retro right after the retro

More details on the goals we want to reach are in the kanban cards above. We took the things we reviewed from the retro on 2/22 and used those to make new kanban cards for sprint 3. 
We aim to finish half of them by next sat meeting, which is on 2/29/20.
