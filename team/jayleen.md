# Personal Description
* 3rd year CS
* Serial hacker but low key a bit retiredâ„¢ - I like making random things and also the hackathon culture but my body is an old man
* Really like playing games though I don't have a lot of time, used to be involved in art and still am today, just not as much
* Coding stuff: Game dev is fun, Web/app dev is fun, (but backend is more fun to me), AR/VR is fun, hardware looks cool but idk that. 
* I like turtles


# Project Brainstorm
* Having the capability to add notes for each laptop you want to compare
* ability to have accounts so that you can access the comparison anywhere
* Hopefully in the future expand form not only laptops but to other devices/products as well
* Aggregate reviews from mulitple sites, maybe use some sentiment analysis libraries to help analyze them. 
* Maybe have some data visualizations to go with the reviews. (always been a fan of word bubbles)
* Have the ability to have "projects" where you are comparing things. so you can compare multiple things differently. 
* AR of the laptop like amazon does with their products if we want to try AR.
* price comparisons from different websites even if main data from amazon
* OOH! price trend over time like in steamdb, I like that data visualization a lot
* I think I like data visualiations - what if another visualiztion that shows the popularity over time? Maybe using google trends or something.
