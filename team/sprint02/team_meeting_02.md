Louie was sick so couldn't attend. 

We all set up the backend hello world again, this time doing using serverless with aws, aws lambda & python. Tina is uploading the setup for it. and will push it to master. 

The purpose of the serverless backend we set up is to get and post json requests, process information/webscraping so that the front end can take care of displaying everything.
