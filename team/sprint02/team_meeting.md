Tonights team gathering (6:30-9pm) consisted of Bryan, Tony, Jayleen, Tina, and Louie. Our team objective was getting AWS connected with a proper database in order to create our HelloWorld for lab03. All in all Python PostgreSQL or DynamoDB seemed like the way to go. However, after careful consideration, we decided to change directions for back-end development. While there is still work to be done on lab03, tonights backend team discussion and brainstorming counted towards a positive step in the right direction. Team 4pm-laptops-comparer is blocked at the moment on this subject, however, we're confident we will make the right choice for the team and overallproject!
