- A list of ideal team behaviors

* Everyone arrives to meetings on time.
* Everyone works on the tasks they are assigned and are responsible for it.
* If someone is blocked, please speak up and ask for help.
* Don't yell at each other. It's totally fine to disagree but don't be aggressive about it.
* Respect each other's time!
