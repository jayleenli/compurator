My name is Bryan and I'm a 2nd year Computer Science major. I am a self-taught full-stack Node.js developer with
some experience in architecting cloud applications. I love working on open-source projects (especially compilers),
I just wish I made any money off of it.

# Project Ideas 

I think it would be cool to build a nice scalable web app with an elegant UI.

Ideally, the UI will be simple and intuitive to use, but powerful enough to support complex use cases.

I would like data and analytics to be easily exportable from our app, so it can be more easily integrated with other
software.
